# nbsp-vscode

A Visual Studio Code extension that highlights non breakable spaces and other similar unicode characters that might be hard to spot, also highlights trailing whitespace.

This is based on [my old sublime extension](https://github.com/possan/sublime_unicode_nbsp/blob/master/sublime_unicode_nbsp.py) that does the same thing and that i'm using all the time, since i switched to Visual Studio Code i really miss this.

## Installation

Open the "Install Extension"-pane in Visual Studio Code and search for `nbsp-vscode` and click "install".
